Generally, paddy is harvested when the grains have reached physiological maturity, indicated by a change in color from green to golden yellow or light brown, and the moisture content is around 18-25%. This usually occurs between 25 to 35 days after flowering, but it can vary depending on the specific conditions of each paddy field."},{"qns":"What are the different methods of harvesting paddy?","ans":"Mechanized Harvesting: This involves using combine harvesters equipped with cutting and threshing mechanisms to harvest and separate the paddy grains from the straw in a single operation. Manual Harvesting: In regions where mechanized equipment is not readily available or suitable, paddy is harvested manually using sickles or handheld cutting tools. Workers cut the rice plants close to the ground and gather them into bundles for further processing. Semi-Mechanized Harvesting: This method combines manual labor with machinery, where laborers use handheld tools to cut the rice plants, and machinery is used for threshing and separating the grains from the straw."},{"qns":"How is paddy dried after harvest, and why is it important?","ans":"After harvest, paddy undergoes a drying process to reduce its moisture content to safe storage levels (around 14% or lower) and prevent mold growth and spoilage. Drying can be achieved using natural methods such as sun drying, where the paddy is spread out in thin layers on drying floors or mats exposed to sunlight, or using mechanical dryers for faster and more controlled drying. Proper drying ensures the longevity and quality of the paddy, preserving its nutritional value and preventing post-harvest losses."}]','created_at' => '2024-03-25 11:00:43','updated_at' => '2024-03-25 11:00:43'),
